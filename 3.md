# Room 3 Review

## `i`)

Content is interesting and supplemented formatting that makes quotes and titles distinctive, and by pictures which are nice to look at. Visual presentation is a little incosistant across the `Cryptography In The Past` and `Modern Cybersecurity` pages. Looks good but doesn't match.

## `ii`)

Unused files and folders like `test.html` and `dev` in the repository. Removing them would neaten things up.

## `iii`)

Good.

## `iv`)

A few of errors on
- `https://validator.w3.org/`

when tested, but generally good.

## `v`)

Author info was not written by the author. Contributions were balanced and the page was not done last minute.


**very good**
